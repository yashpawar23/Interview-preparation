    <p>Q.1 How many operators do we have in JS ?</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
        We have 6 types of operators in JS they are
             1. Arithmetic Operators : + - * / %
             2. Comparison Operators : == === != !==
             3. Logical Operators : && || !
             4. Assignment Operators : =
             5. Conditional Operators
             6. Ternary Operator ?:

    <p>Q.2 What are arrow functions?</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>Arrow function introduced in ES6 version of javascript .<br>
          Arrow function is also called as fat arrow function.<br>
          Arrow function stored in a variable.<br>
          In arrow function no need of function key word.<br>
       </p>

       Ex.-
       let X = (X,Y) => X*Y;

    <p>Q.3 Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
        <P>Undefined
            undefined is a global variable that JavaScript creates at run time. JavaScript assigns undefined<br>
            to any variable that has been declared but not initialized. In other words, in a case where no<br>
            value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it undefined.</P>

        <P>null
            It is one of JavaScriptâ€™s primitive data type and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.null is<br>
            an empty or non-existent value and null must be assigned. We use null when we want to<br>
            explicitly declare that a variable is empty.</P>

        <P>not defined
            A not defined is a variable that is not declared inside the code at a given point of time with<br>
            declaration keyword like var, let, or const.</P>

    <p>Q.4 What is callback hell</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
         <p>Callback Hell is a pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read.
         The callback hell looks like a pyramid structure.</p>
        Ex-

        setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log("hellow1")
            setTimeout(()=>{
                console.log("hellow2")
                setTimeout(()=>{
                    console.log("hellow3")
                    setTimeout(()=>{
                        console.log("hellow4")
                        setTimeout(()=>{
                            console.log("hellow5")
                            
                        },1000)
                        
                    },1000)
                    
                },1000)
                
            },1000)
            
        },1000)

    <p>Q.5 Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
        <p>IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it
            is defined and it is anonymous function.</p>
        
            (function ()
                {
                  var text = "day3;
                  console.log(text); //IIFE
             }
                )();
                console.log(text); //Error: message is not defined

    <p>Q.6 What is the use of setTimeout</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>The setTimeout() method calls a function after a number of milliseconds.  <br>
        The setTimeout is executed only once.  <br>
        We use this to delay some kind of executions.  <br>
       </p>
        Ex-

         const printText=()=>{
                 setTimeout(function(){
              console.log(`welcome Yash`)
                 },2000)
            
             }
             printText()
            
    </pre>
