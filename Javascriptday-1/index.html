     <p>Q.1 Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>Both are comparator operators .thet return boolean values. <br>
        The main diifrence is:- <br>
        "==" is used to the compare the value only.(Loose equality) <br>
        "===" is used to the compare the value and datatype.(strict equality) <br>
       </p>

    <p>Q.2 What is the spread operator?</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
        <p>The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to destructure the non-primitive data types like<br>
            arrays and objects to access the elements individually</p>
        
            const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
               const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
               const numbersCombined = [...array1, ...array2];
               console.log(numbersCombined)
               Output:
               [1,2,3,4,5,6]

    <p>Q.3 What are the differences between var, let and const?</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
        <p>var is a global scoped means variables created using var keyword will be accessible globally. It<br>
            can be redeclared and reinitialized.<br>
            var a = 10;</p>

        <p>let is a block scoped means variables created using let keyword will be accessible only in that<br>
            specific block where it has been declared. It cannot be redeclared but it can be reinitialized.<br>
            let a = 20</p>

        <p>const is also block scoped means variables created using const keyword will be accessible only<br>
            in that specific block where it has been declared. It cannot be redeclared and cannot be<br>
            reinitialized.<br>
            const a = 30</p>

    <p>Q.4 What is execution context</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
        <p>
            Each and every browser is having a JavaScript Engine, example Google is having V8 engine,<br>
            Internet Explorer is having Chakra and Mozilla Firefox is having Spider Monkey.<br>
            JS engine uses a Call stack and also creates a special environment to handle the execution of<br>
            the JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.<br>
            The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in<br>
            its execution.<br>
            During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables<br>
            and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets<br>
            executed.<br>
            There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:<br>
            ● Global Execution Context (GEC)<br>
            ● Function Execution Context (FEC)<br>
        </p>

    <p>Q.5 What is meant by first class functions</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
        <p>The first class function is the ability of functions to be use theres values and can be passed <br>
        this in agrgument to the unother function and can be return from the function is this ability known<br>
         as first class function.</p>

    <p>Q.6 What are closures? Give an example of closure</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
        <p>A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its<br>
            surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an<br>
            outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a<br>
            function is created, at function creation time.</p>

        function x(){
            var a=23;
            function y(){
                console.log(a)
            }
          y();
        }
        x();

    <p>Q.7 Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind().</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>call(): The call() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and rest<br>
        of the arguments required by function will be provided as an individual arguments.<br>
        </p>

       <p>apply(): The apply() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and<br>
        rest of the arguments will be passed as an array of elements.</p>

        <p>bind: The bind() method returns a new function and this function will be having the reference<br>
            of the object passed, now whenever you want to use this returned function in the code you can<br>
            use it by passing rest of the arguments.</p>

         Ex -

            student1 = {
                firstName :"Yash",
                lastName:"Pawar"
            }
            
            student2 = {
                firstName :"omkar",
                lastName:"Pawar"
            }
            
            
            
            let printFullName = function(hometown,state,){
                console.log(this.firstName + this.lastName + "from" + " " + hometown );
            }
            
            printFullName.call(student1,"MUMBAI","MAHARASHTRA");   -------call()
            printFullName.apply(student1,["MUMBAI","MAHARASHTRA"]);-------apply()
            
             let fullMyName = printFullName.bind(student2,"DUBAI");
             console.log(fullMyNane);
             fullMyNane();                                         --------bind()
