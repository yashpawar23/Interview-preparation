    <p>Q.1 What is hoisting?.</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.<br>
         Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation. Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

       </p>

        Ex-
       console.log(message);    //output : undefined
       var message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
    </pre>
    <br><hr>

    <p>Q.2 What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords,<br>
        but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError.<br>
        The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variableâ€™s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.</p>

        Ex-

        function somemethod() {
            console.log(counter1); // undefined
            console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
            var counter1 = 1;
            let counter2 = 2;
          }
    </pre>

    <p>Q.3 What is the DOM?.</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the<br>
        structure and content of a document on the web.<br>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It<br>
        represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.<br>
        The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can<br>
        interact with the page.<br>
       </p>

    <p>Q.4 Explain passed by value and passed by reference</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>Both are comparator operators .thet return boolean values. <br>
        The main diifrence is:- <br>
        "==" is used to the compare the value only.(Loose equality) <br>
        "===" is used to the compare the value and datatype.(strict equality) <br>
       </p>
    </pre>

    <p>Q.5 Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       Ex- map()

                const array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];

         // pass a function to map
         const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);

         console.log(array1)
         // expected output: array1[1,4,9,16]
         console.log(map1);
         // expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]

         Ex- filter()

         const words = ['spray', 'limit', 'elite', 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present'];

          const result = words.filter(word => word.length > 6);

          console.log(result);
          // expected output: Array ["exuberant", "destruction", "present"]

    <p>Q.6 What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is<br>
        permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based<br>
        behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need promise chains.<br>
       </p>
    </pre>

    <p>Q.1 Give an example of async/await</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
        let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            setTimeout(function () {
            resolve('Promise resolved')}, 4000);
            });
            async function asyncFunc() {
            // wait until the promise resolves
            let result = await promise;
            console.log(result);
            console.log('hello');
            }
            // calling the async function
            asyncFunc();
            
    </pre>
