    <p>Q.1 Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript.</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>Global scope:A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered
        a global scope variable</p>

        Ex.
        var a=3;
           function greet()
           {
           console.log(a);
           }
           greet()

        <p>Local scope:A variable can also have a local scope, i.e it can only be accessed within a
            function.</p>

            Ex.
            var a=4;
              function add()
              {
              var q=4;
              console.log(a+b);
              }
              greet()

        <p>Block scope: It is related to the variables declared using let and const. Variables declared with
            var do not have block scope.<br>
            Block scope tells us that any variable declared inside a block { }, can be accessed only inside
            that block and cannot be accessed outside of it.</p>

        <p>scope chain: JavaScript engine also uses Scope to find variables.</p>

           Ex-
           var x=24;
               function OuterFunction()
               {
               var s=224;
               var innerfunction=function innerfunction()
               {
               console.log(s);
               }
               var innerfunction2=function innerfunction2()
               {
               console.log(x);
               }
               innerfunction();
               innerfunction2();
               }
               OuterFunction()
    </pre>

    <p>Q.2 What is difference between null and undefined ?.</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a
        value, such as:
       </p>
       Ex-
       var testVar;
        alert(testVar); //shows undefined

        <p>null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value:
        </p>

        Ex-
        var testVar = null; alert(testVar); //shows nul
    </pre>
    <br><hr>

    <p>Q.3 What is an event loop and call stack.</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) <br>
        to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently <br>
        being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc. or we can say that it <br>
        stores global execution context and function execution context.
       </p>

       <p>The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the<br>
        call stack. All the web apis functions like setTimeout, setInterval, fetch calls etc. will not be<br>
        directly executed inside the execution context, firstly they will be moved to callback queue and<br>
        then the moment call stack gets empty these functions will be pushed to call stack from<br>
        callback queue by event loop.</p>
    </pre>

    <p>Q.4 What are promises and why do we need them?.</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>

        <p>Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage<br>
            when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell<br>
            leading to unmanageable code.</p>
       <p>Benefits of Promises <br>
        1. Improves Code Readability <br>
        2. Better handling of asynchronous operations <br>
        3. Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic <br>
        4. Better Error Handling</p>
    </pre>

    <p>Q.5 What is promise chaining.</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is
        known as Promise chaining.
       </p>
       new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
        }).then(function(result) {
        console.log(result); // 1
        return result * 2;
        }).then(function(result) {
        console.log(result); // 2
        return result * 3;
        }).then(function(result) {
        console.log(result); // 6
        return result * 4;
        })
    </pre>

    <p>Q.1 Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</p>
    <p>ANS</p>
    <pre>
       <p>Pure Function is a function (a block of code ) that always returns the same result if the same<br>
        arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state, or data change during a program’s<br>
        execution rather it only depends on its input arguments.
       </p>

       function calculateGST( productPrice ) {
        return productPrice * 0.05;
        }
