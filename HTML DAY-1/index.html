       <!-- 5. Block and Inline :-
       In HTML, block element always begins on the new line , it extends from left to right where browser automatically 
       gives some margin from both side.

       Inline- <span> , <img> -->

       <!-- 6.em and strong:-
       Tags are better alternative option of 'b' & 'i' tag we should prefer using em and strong 
       instead of b and i.
       strong is used to show the strong importance of text and em is used to show the text
       in diffrent manner , just to change the voice tone. -->

       <!-- 7.Attributes:-

       Attributes are those elements are nothing but the properties provided to that element.
